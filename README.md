A quick guide on how to disable SSL/TLS via a GPO and/or Powershell Script that hacks the registry

Disabling TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 is considered a good idea for several reasons, primarily related to security and compliance. Here are the key reasons why it is recommended:

1. **Security Weaknesses**: TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 have known security vulnerabilities that make them susceptible to attacks. As technology and encryption standards evolve, older versions become less secure over time. By disabling them, you ensure that your systems are using the latest and most secure protocols.

2. **Compliance Requirements**: Many industry regulations and standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require the use of secure protocols. Disabling older, vulnerable protocols like TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 helps you meet these compliance requirements.

3. **Encouraging Stronger Encryption**: Disabling older versions of TLS encourages websites and applications to use more secure versions, such as TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3. By doing this, you promote the adoption of stronger encryption algorithms and better security practices.

4. **Future-Proofing**: As the internet evolves, older TLS versions may become unsupported by modern browsers and applications. Disabling them proactively ensures that your systems will continue to work securely with future technologies.

5. **Mitigating Vulnerabilities**: Certain security vulnerabilities, like BEAST and POODLE attacks, are specific to TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1. Disabling these protocols helps protect your systems from such vulnerabilities.

6. **Performance Improvements**: By disabling older, less efficient protocols, you can potentially improve the performance and speed of your encrypted connections.

7. **Maintaining User Trust**: Taking security seriously and using up-to-date encryption protocols instills trust in your users and customers. It shows that you prioritize their data security and privacy.

Before disabling TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1, it's crucial to ensure that your infrastructure and applications are compatible with the newer TLS versions (TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3). Some older systems, particularly those running on outdated software, may not support these newer protocols. It's essential to verify compatibility and perform thorough testing before making any changes to your security settings.
